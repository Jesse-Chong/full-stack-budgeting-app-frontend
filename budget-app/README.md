(1) NavBar
* The NavBar allows me to navigate to the index, new entry or statistics page.

(2) Index Page
* I can see an organized list of debits or credits I manually put in, along with the date, and item name.
* On top of the page I can see my total bank account from subtracting the debit and credit.

(3) New Page
* I can click on new in the navbar to take me to a form that lets me create a new transaction.
* Once a transaction is created, I am shown the full details of what I created.

(4) Show Page / delete button
* I can see full details of a single item along with having the option to delete, edit or go back.

(5) Edit Page
* When I click on edit next to an item I can see a form that is pre-filled with the same information of that particular item I clicked along with being able to update it.

(6) Account Total
* CSS changes depending on the amount, used a greenish color if the bank account total is above 100, used a yellowish color if the bank account total is between 0 and 100 and a reddish color if the bank account total is less than 0. 

(7) UX/UI
* Used bootstrap to style every page, form, and button, along with having every page fit into smaller screens.

(8) Stretch Goals
* Used date object for human-readable format.
* Added a statistics page showing percentage of total money spent based on the total debit in the account.

(9) Chart inside statistics (Bonus Feature for the future)
* Use a graph to visually show how much $ I spend per week using the total amount of dollars debited and credited per week.
